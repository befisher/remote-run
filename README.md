Remote-Run can help you run commands remotely via browser.

## Run Commands via Browser

You may have several frequently used commands and of course you can add global shortcuts to your PC.
But sometimes you may want to run commands through your browser, EX. remotely.

With Remote-Run you can customize whatever commands and therefore do a lot of jobs.
Have fun with it :)

## Consider the Security Problem

You are the one who are responsible for the security of your PC since Remote-Run does not recognize bad guys.

## Installation and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fisher95/remote-run.git
cd remote-run
npm install
npm start
```

## Run Example

Run server at port 3000 `npm start`.

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.
